/**
 * Provides the SOAP utility for the
 * <code>CMICContactServiceUtil</code> service
 * utility. The static methods of this class call the same methods of the
 * service utility. However, the signatures are different because it is
 * difficult for SOAP to support certain types.
 *
 * <p>
 * The benefits of using the SOAP utility is that it is cross platform
 * compatible. SOAP allows different languages like Java, .NET, C++, PHP, and
 * even Perl, to call the generated services. One drawback of SOAP is that it is
 * slow because it needs to serialize all calls into a text format (XML).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can see a list of services at http://localhost:8080/api/axis. Set the
 * property <b>axis.servlet.hosts.allowed</b> in portal.properties to configure
 * security.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The SOAP utility is only generated for remote services.
 * </p>
